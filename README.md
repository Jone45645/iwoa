# iwoa

The iwoa project aims to use the Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA) to solve large-scale single-objective and multi-objective job-shop scheduling problems (JSP). JSP is a classic combinatorial optimization problem involving the assignment of tasks to machines to optimize objectives like minimizing makespan or balancing performance metrics. The project enhances the original whale optimization algorithm by improving initial solution generation, introducing a hybrid search strategy, optimizing the fitness function, and implementing dynamic parameter adjustments.

## Overview

The iwoa project is implemented using MATLAB for the core algorithm development and testing. The architecture is modular, consisting of the following modules:
- **Algorithm core module**: Implements the main IWOA functions.
- **Problem definition module**: Handles loading and validation of job-shop scheduling problem definitions.
- **User interface module**: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for user inputs and visualization of results.
- **Data storage module**: Manages the storage of problem definitions, algorithm parameters, and solution results.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- MATLAB: MATLAB is required for running the core algorithm and the GUI.

### Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd iwoa
   ```

2. **Open MATLAB** and navigate to the project directory.

3. **Run the main algorithm**:
   ```matlab
   % Example: Running the algorithm with a sample problem definition and parameters
   problemFilePath = 'path/to/problemDefinition.mat';
   algorithmParams = struct('populationSize', 50, 'maxIterations', 100, 'mutationRate', 0.1);
   solution = algorithmCore(problemFilePath, algorithmParams);
   ```

4. **Launch the GUI** (if available):
   ```matlab
   % Command to launch the GUI (to be implemented)
   launchGUI();
   ```
